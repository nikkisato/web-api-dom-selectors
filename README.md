- Web APIs
## DOM selectors
# Challenge
- Build a sample vanilla js project that utilizes the following web apis below. To implement these you will also need to use DOM selection methods like querySelector and querySelectorAll
## Mutation Observer
- Listen for DOM updates and do something. (You'll probably need to use javascript to trigger that update)
## Intersection Observer
- Listen for scroll position. Animate something when the user crosses a threshold
## DOM Parser
- Fetch html (this can come in handy in Shopify where you need data that does not exist in the "ajax" json response, but does exist on a pdp somewhere)
## eg code:
- CustomEvent (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CustomEvent/CustomEvent#example)
- This is a similar concept to the Event Emitter in Node.js - it allows the developer to create reactive, event-driven websites
## EyeDropper API
- This is experimental - just implement for fun!
- What is the object returned from querySelectorAll called and how does it differ from an Array object in javascript?
